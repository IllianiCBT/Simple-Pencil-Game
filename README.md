# Simple-Pencil-Game
A simple game where a single player competes against a bot to empty a pencil case first. Built as part of JetBrains Academy's 'Python for Beginners' study track. https://hyperskill.org/tracks/6

# Rules
Players take turns to remove pencils from the case, the first player unable to do this (due to the case being empty) loses.

The bot is an expert in the game, rendering it impossible for the human player to win.
